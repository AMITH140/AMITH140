 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª AVS's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 Hello, my name is Amith VS, and I started my programming journey at the age of 15. I was always fascinated by technology and the way it shapes our lives. I wanted to be a part of this world and contribute to it in my own way. So, I started learning how to code.

My first programming language was Python. I found it to be a very easy language to learn, and it helped me build a strong foundation in programming. I started with simple programs like calculating the area of a triangle or the circumference of a circle. I then moved on to more complex programs like building a simple chatbot.

As I got more comfortable with programming, I started exploring new languages like Java and C++. I found these languages to be more challenging, but also more rewarding. I started building more complex programs like a web scraper and a website.

One of my biggest achievements so far has been building my own website. I wanted to create a platform where I could showcase my projects and connect with other developers. It was a lot of hard work, but it was also a lot of fun. I learned a lot about web development and how to build a scalable application.

Another project that I am really proud of is my AI chatbot. I wanted to build something that could communicate with people and provide useful information. It was a challenging project, but it was also a lot of fun. I learned a lot about natural language processing and how to build intelligent applications.

Currently, I am learning Kotlin, which is a modern programming language used for Android development. I am also studying blockchain and web 3.0, as I believe that these technologies will shape the future of the internet.

My journey so far has been full of ups and downs, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Programming has taught me patience, perseverance, and problem-solving skills. It has also opened up a world of possibilities and opportunities for me.

I am excited to see where this journey takes me in the future. I hope to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I hope to make a positive impact in the world through my work. Thank you for listening to my story
